 Text Count Tool

A simple web-based tool to count words, characters, and paragraphs from the text input. This tool is useful for quickly analyzing the length of text and is easy to integrate into any web page.

 Features

- Count the number of words, characters, and paragraphs in real-time as you type or paste the text.
- Clean and minimalistic design, easy to use for any user.
- Responsive and mobile-friendly interface.

 Demo

You can check the live demo of the Text Count Tool [here](insert your demo link).

 Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the basic structure of the page.
- **CSS**: For styling the layout and interactive elements.
- **JavaScript**: To update and display real-time text count data (words, characters, and paragraphs).

 How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in your preferred browser.
3. Start typing or paste any text into the input area, and the word count, character count, and paragraph count will update instantly.

 Setup

 Prerequisites

Make sure you have a modern web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).

 Instructions

1. Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/text-count-tool.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder**:
   ```bash
   cd text-count-tool
   ```

3. **Open `index.html` in your browser**:
   - Just double-click the `index.html` file, and it will open in your default browser.

## How It Works

- The text input field listens for changes (`input` event).
- As you type or paste text, the `updateCounts()` function is triggered.
- It calculates:
  - **Words**: The number of words based on space-separated values.
  - **Characters**: The total character count of the input text, including spaces.
  - **Paragraphs**: The number of paragraphs, based on line breaks (`\n`).
